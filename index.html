        <h2><u>Coding Journey</u></h2>
        <p>After my diploma programme at Logictech, my boss introduced me to coding and gave me some pdf's to read on getting started with basic HTML and CSS. I was not really serious about it then due to the fact that i had no computer system. During my national diploma programme at the polytechnic, i met with some friends who motivated me on getting started with coding and that was how i ventured into the world of programming. So far so good, there have been breaks due to some challenges but with this initiative of <a href="www.stackademic.com" target= "_blank">StackademicHQ</a> has been started by <a href="www.sunilsandhu.com" target="_blank">Sunil Sandhu</a>. I am really enjoying the way he has been teaching us. He literally has a differnt approach to coding world. And I'm lovin' it. Ive, promised myself to be consistent, determined and hardworking in order to achieve the next chapter in the book of my goals i.e 
          <strong>becoming a good fullstack developer</strong> </p><br>
